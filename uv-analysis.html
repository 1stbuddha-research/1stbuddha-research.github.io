    <h2>Why UV matters for Nepal bronzes</h2>
    <p>
        UV-light examination is used here to separate real, long-term ageing from modern coatings or fresh
        restorations. On authentic Nepal bronzes the UV response is usually irregular: patches of dull,
        almost dead zones next to fine, bright speckling where old minerals and remains of mercury gilding
        have built up over centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
        The 59 cm Nepal Buddha documented on this site shows exactly this mixed pattern. Fluorescent grains
        sit inside engraved lines and deep relief zones, while exposed high points stay comparatively quiet
        under UV. This supports a reading of natural wear rather than a recent artificial patina.
    </p>

    <h2>UV documentation of the robe surface</h2>

    </figure>

    <p>
        On the robe, UV reveals a dense field of tiny green-blue points following the Newar scrollwork.
        These grains sit low in the engraved pattern, exactly where original fire gilding and later
        mineralisation would be protected from touch and polishing. The effect is strongest in recessed
        folds of the garment and weaker on the most exposed ridges.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Bright speckling concentrated in engraved lines and recesses.</li>
        <li>Soft, cloud-like fluorescence where gilding residues mix with oxidised copper alloys.</li>
        <li>No flat, uniform modern varnish layer; the surface remains optically broken and irregular.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Underside and casting interior under UV</h2>

    <figure>
        <img src="uv/uvnepal2.jpeg" alt="UV analysis of the underside and inner casting of a Nepal bronze Buddha">
        <figcaption>
            Interior and underside under UV: mineral accretions and old casting skin rather than fresh
            polishing or synthetic coatings.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Inside the casting and around the underside of the base, UV-light brings out a completely different
        texture. Instead of a smooth, modern looking surface, the metal shows rough, granular casting skin,
        with crusts of pale blue and green accretions along ridges and cavities.
    </p>

    <p>
        These deposits respond with a dry, matte fluorescence, typical of old copper corrosion and
        salt/mineral build-up. There is no evidence of sprayed lacquer, recent restoration filler or
        other synthetic materials that would create broad, even glowing films under UV.
    </p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>How UV fits into the wider research triangle</h2>
    <p>
        UV analysis is only one leg of the triangle. For every Nepal bronze in the 1stbuddha collection,
        UV observations are combined with:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Microscopy of gilding residues, tool marks and patina layers.</li>
        <li>Study of inner casting walls, core material and joins.</li>
        <li>Comparative work with published Nepal and Himalayan bronzes in museum collections.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Together these methods make it easier to defend a 17th-century dating for the 59 cm Buddha and
        to distinguish it from later Nepalese or Tibetan workshop pieces that imitate the same iconography
        but lack this depth of ageing.
