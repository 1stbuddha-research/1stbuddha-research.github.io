    <h1>Nepal Bronze Buddha Research – Linked to 1stbuddha</h1>

    <div class="block">
        <p>
            This site functions as a small, independent research hub for
            <strong>Nepal bronze Buddha sculptures</strong>. It documents microscope
            images, UV results and casting evidence from objects studied in the
            <a href="https://www.1stbuddha.com/">1stbuddha</a> collection and compares them
            with published museum pieces and auction records.
        </p>
        <p>
            The aim is simple: to show how careful technical observation
            (patina, tool marks, gilding residues, inner casting walls) can help
            distinguish genuinely old Nepal bronzes from later workshop work or
            modern reproductions.

        <h2>Core focus: 17th-century Newar fire-gilded bronzes</h2>
        <p>
            A central case study is a large <strong>17th-century Newar Buddha</strong>,
            fire-gilded and deeply engraved, with early Himalayan casting features.
            The full documentation, including microscope shots and UV photography,
            is published on Humanities Commons:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://1stbuddha.hcommons.org/2025/11/14/seventeenth-century-nepal-bronze-buddha-newar-fire-gilded-sculpture-with-early-himalayan-casting-evidence/">
                    Seventeenth-Century Nepal Bronze Buddha – Newar Fire-Gilded Sculpture

        </ul>

            That article is directly connected to the corresponding object record on

        <h2>Method: microscopy, UV and internal casting surfaces</h2>
        <p>
            Every documented Buddha is examined with a stereo microscope and UV light.
            Particular attention is given to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>engraved robe patterns and the depth of Newar chasing work,</li>
            <li>remains of original 24 kt fire gilding and later surface coatings,</li>
            <li>inner casting walls, core material and old mineral accretions,</li>
            <li>tool marks, repairs and early workshop joins.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Short research notes from these examinations are then linked back to
            the corresponding product pages on <a href="https://www.1stbuddha.com/">1stbuddha</a>.

    <div class="block">
        <h2>Why Nepal bronze Buddhas matter</h2>
        <p>
            Newar metalworkers from the Kathmandu Valley supplied outstanding
            bronze and copper-alloy images to Nepal, Tibet, Ladakh and beyond.
            Their 16th–17th century bronzes combine refined proportions with
            exceptionally fine scroll engraving and complex, segmented casting.
            Many later Himalayan Buddhas imitate this language but show simpler
            bases and less demanding production.
        </p>
        <p>
            By publishing clear technical documentation of individual pieces,
            this project hopes to make the visual language of <strong>authentic Nepal
            bronze Buddhas</strong> easier to recognise for scholars, students and
            collectors.

        <h2>About 1stbuddha</h2>
        <p>
            1stbuddha is an independent collection focused on documented Buddha
            statues and related Asian art. Each object receives a concise report,
            based on the same museum-grade analytical methods described here.
            Selected highlights are made available for sale, but the primary
            emphasis remains on documentation and research.
